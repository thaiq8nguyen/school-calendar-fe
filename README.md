1️⃣ [UX Design files](🚫add link to design files here) - 🚫 delete if not applicable

School Calendar was an app idea brought to Lambda from a school coach. The coach would like a calendar that he could update with various events and push to a larger source i.e. google, outlook, or Ical.

Along with these things notifying changes to a schedule the coach would like to update things inside the events such as time and location. The last key feature would be event templates that can be placed in bulk across unrelated days.

# APIs

## 2️⃣ FireBase Authentication
Using FireBase authentication, Firebase handles most of the information for us while giving us multiple options with which we can log in. The two forms of authentication we are using is email and password, and google login.


## 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following: (I can update to the actual .env code)


```
export const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID,
  measurementId: process.env.REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID
};
```
